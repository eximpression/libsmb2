To run the test you need an SMB server that exports a share and
two configurations files:

1, ./tests/NTLM
===============
This file contains the username to password mapping you need to authenticate
to the server with NTLM.

Example:
$ cat tests/NTLM
win16-1:Administrator:mypassword
$

2, tests/setup.local
====================
This file sets two environment variables the tests need, NTLM_USER_FILE
and TESTURL.

Example:
$ cat tests/setup.local
TESTURL=smb://Administrator@win16-1/Share
NTLM_USER_FILE=`pwd`/NTLM
$

A good idea is to use a special share/subdirectory on the server
so that the tests do not overwrite/corrupt/delete important files.
Create a dedicated share on the server that is only used for testing
and be prepared that any data in this share can be randomly deleted.
